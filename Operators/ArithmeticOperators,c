/*
Arithmetic Operators

Operators used to perform operations on values.

First, we will discuss the most basic arithmetic operators, maybe they are familiar from math classes.

Operator	Operation	Example
+	Addition	3 + 2 = 5
-	Subtraction	3 - 2 = 1
*	Multiplication	3 * 2 = 6
/	Division	4 / 2 = 2
%	Modulus (reminder after division)	3 % 2 = 1
Let's see a usage example,

int a = 3;
int b = 5;
int c = a + b; // c holds 8
