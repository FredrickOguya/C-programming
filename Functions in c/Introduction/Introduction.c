Introduction

In programming, functions are a fundamental concept that allows us to reuse a block of code whenever needed simply by calling it.

A function can be defined as a named block of code that contains specific instructions. By using its name, we can invoke the function at any place within our program.

This course will introduce you to using functions in C, step by step, with challenges designed to help you become comfortable using them in various situations.

- Disclaimer -
In order to succeed in this course, it is important to actively engage with the material. Be sure to attempt the challenges on your own first. If you encounter difficulty, you can refer to the hints and eventually the solution (if necessary).
